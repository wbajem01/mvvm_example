# mvvm_example

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for my Model View View Model Flutter application.

There's not much to it but I'll note the following:

1. It uses the Singleton design pattern.
2. It's my first MVVM application.
3. It uses and API to get data from the web.
